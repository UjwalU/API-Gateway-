# API Gateway

The API Gateway is a centralized entry point for accessing multiple APIs. It provides a unified interface for clients to interact with various microservices and backend systems. This project is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

## Features

- **API Routing**: Route requests to the appropriate microservices based on predefined rules.
- **Middleware Support**: Implement custom middleware for authentication, logging, rate limiting, etc.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling to ensure consistent responses across APIs.
- **Database Integration**: Connect to MongoDB to store and retrieve data.
- **RESTful APIs**: Expose RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations on resources.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale horizontally to handle increased traffic and load.
- **Security**: Implement security measures such as CORS, JWT authentication, and input validation.
